title: Uploading files to Mundi
description: Mundi supports .gpkg, .fgb, .geojson, shapefiles in .zip, .tif, .kml, .kmz, .laz, and .csv file uploads.

Mundi supports most vector and raster file formats. You can also upload CSV spreadsheets and LAS/LAZ point cloud files.

Drag and drop a file directly onto the map to upload it to Mundi. You can also click on `Add Layer Source` > `Upload file`
in the layer list to open the file browser.

Uploading files can also be done via [the Mundi developer API](/developer-api/operations/upload_layer_to_map/).

## Vector spatial data

Mundi supports FlatGeobuf (`.fgb`), GeoPackage (`.gpkg`), GeoJSON (`.geojson`), KML/KMZ (`.kml`, `.kmz`), and Shapefiles. Files in any CRS/projection
will work. Vector data is stored in its original CRS but is reprojected to Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) for display (tiles).

Other files supported by GDAL may work, but are not tested regularly. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/BuntingLabs/mundi.ai/issues/new)
to request a new file format.

### GeoPackage support

Currently, Mundi will load the first layer in a GeoPackage file, and does not import styles embedded from QGIS.
You will need to export the GeoPackage's individual layers to load them all.

### Shapefile support

To import a shapefile into Mundi, you should put the `.shp`, `.dbf`, `.shx`, and `.prj` files in a single ZIP archive
and then upload that to Mundi.

## Raster data

Mundi supports GeoTIFFs (`.tif` and `.tiff`, includes COGs) and DEM (`.dem`)files. Only single-band and RGB data is supported. Single-band data
will be assigned a color map from its min and max values. Raster data is stored in its original CRS.

## LAS/LAZ point clouds

Mundi supports `.las` and `.laz` point cloud uploads. Point clouds must have a CRS associated with them. Right now, point clouds
are loaded entirely into memory in the browser, so we highly recommend downsampling point clouds before uploading.

## Spreadsheets (CSV)

Mundi accepts `.csv` files where each row represents a point. Your CSV must have a header row with column names
that separate out latitude and longitude columns with coordinates in WGS84 / EPSG:4326.

For example, this CSV would successfully upload to Mundi:

```csv
name,yelp_score,lat,lng
Beachside building,4.5,37.735482,-122.506563
Yacht Club,4.7,37.850417,-122.531423
```

### Supported column names

To detect and convert to spatial data, you must have latitude and longitude columns. The following column names are detected:

Latitude: `lat`, `latitude`, `y`, `Y`, `Latitude`, `LAT`, or `LATITUDE`

Longitude: `lon`, `longitude`, `lng`, `x`, `X`, `Longitude`, `LON`, or `LONGITUDE`

### Geocoding addresses

Mundi does not currently support geocoding addresses in uploaded CSV files. If you have tabular data, like Excel spreadsheets,
CSVs, etc., we recommend you use [geocodio](https://www.geocod.io/) or [geoapify](https://www.geoapify.com/tools/geocoding-online/)
to geocode the addresses first. This may require you to edit the headers in the resulting CSV so that `latitude` and `longitude`
columns exist.
